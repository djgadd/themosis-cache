Themosis Cache
==============

A WordPress plugin for the Themosis framework that implements the illuminate/cache
package and provides a default store driver built on the back of WP_Object_Cache.

Install
-------
Install through composer: -

`composer require keltiecochrane/themosis-cache`

Activate the plugin in WordPress and that's it. See the
[Laravel Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.4/cache) for further info.

And you're good to go. Remember, it uses WP_Object_Cache so you'll need an object cache plugin installed (such as http://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/)

Support
-------
This plugin is provided as is, though we'll endeavour to help where we can.
